# Master Painter Gallery

For this project, you’re going to be creating a dynamic website that showcases great works of art.  With the backend provided, create a front-end in react that has the following elements:
- A gallery that displays all the images
- Sort the gallery by painting title & painting year
- Filter this gallery view by title & at least ONE other element (try for compound filtering - filter by more than one criteria at once)
- BONUS: You can have a “favorite” section where you can add and delete paintings
- BONUS: Use the harvard art museum's API instead of OR in addition to the backend we’ve created

Instructions for getting started:
1. Clone down this repo
2. Bundle
3. Run `rake db:setup`
4. Check out the database schema and the endpoints you can use to get your data back in JSON 
5. Use the “create-react-app” command to start a brand new react project
6. Design your components how you like and make requests to get the necessary info
7. Feel free to modify the backend to add extra functionality
8. We’ll be showing off our completed galleries on Monday morning so feel free to make them visually interesting with your own CSS or using a CSS framework!
